```javascript
//Incorrect usage of $inc operator for updating a field in MongoDB
db.collection.updateOne({name:"John"},{$inc:{age:10}});
//The above code will only update the age field if the document with the name "John" exists and has an age field. If the document exists but doesn't have the age field, this operation won't add the field and set its value to 10. Instead of using $inc for creating a field and assigning value, we should use the $set operator.

//Correct usage of $set and $inc operator
db.collection.updateOne({name:"John"},{$set:{age:10}}); //For creating new field and setting value
db.collection.updateOne({name:"John"},{$inc:{age:10}});//For updating existing field
```
